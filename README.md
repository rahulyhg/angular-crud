# Angular-CRUD
A simple CRUD Application using AngularJS, BootStrap, SlimPHP, NotORM

I have taken initial boilerplate from here - http://www.angularcode.com/product-inventory-management-using-angularjs-mysql-and-php-restful-api/ but i know there is long way creating a perfect AngularJS CRUD Application.

Components - 

1. AngularJS - For creating single page fast,reliable MVC Structure
2. BootStrap - Version 3.x for providing effective UI
3. SlipPHP - For handling server side backend with fast, reliable Php Micro Framework
4. NotORM - For efficiently managing and maintaining myswl database queries via a lightweight ORM based on php
